# MovieHub - React App

MovieHub is a simple movie tracking app built with React and Vite. It allows users to create a watchlist and manage collections. Data is stored in the browser's localStorage, so your information is preserved only on the current device. If you clear your browser data or switch devices, your watchlist and collections may be lost.

## Features
Watchlist & Collections: Easily add movies to your watchlist and collections.

Local Storage: All data is stored in your browser's localStorage, making it fast and offline-friendly.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI for a seamless experience across devices.

Fast Refresh: With Viteâ€™s Fast Refresh, your app will reload instantly as you make changes.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
